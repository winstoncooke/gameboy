# Bash Scripts

## Setting up

This setup assumes you are on Linux using bash.  
Scripts should be placed in `/usr/local/bin`.  
For each script, run `chmod +x <script>` to make executable.

**Note:** The filepath in each script defaults to `~/.wine/drive_c/gbdev/<script-folder>`.  
Make sure to update the filepath to wherever you store your executables.

## Usage

Scripts can then be run from the terminal entering the script name (e.g. `bgb` to launch bgb).
